## React form context

A simple usage of [`withContext`](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose/blob/master/docs/API.md#withcontext) and [`getContext`](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose/blob/master/docs/API.md#getcontext) from [recompose](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose), in order to enhance some form like components to easily access props such as `id/htmlForm` in child components.
